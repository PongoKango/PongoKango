# Hi there, I'm Manny! 👋

## About Me

I'm passionate about technology and creativity, blending my love for coding with my interests in art and model building. I focus on:

- 🎮 Game development projects
- 🤖 Automation and scripting tasks

I'm most comfortable working with **Python**, but I'm also learning **GDScript** and **C#** to expand my skills, especially for game development with Godot and Unity.
